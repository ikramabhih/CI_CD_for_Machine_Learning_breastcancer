*Predict breast cancer (Malignant/Benign) from diagnostic features using a Random Forest model and scikit-learn pipelines.*

> **Tutorial reference:** https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/ci-cd-for-machine-learning

## Project Description
In this project, we will use scikit-learn pipelines to train a Random Forest classifier for breast cancer prediction. After training, we will automate the evaluation process using CML and deploy the web application to Hugging Face Spaces. 

From training to evaluation, the process will be fully automated using GitHub Actions. Simply push code to your GitHub repository, and the model, app, and results will be updated on Hugging Face automatically.
